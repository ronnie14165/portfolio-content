      <p>
        I am a second year student majoring in Electrical and Computer
        Engineering at Umich. I love photography when I was young. I am going to
        show more contents about photography with you in this website. My past
        experience: I participated an underwater wireless sensing project named
        EPSRC USMART collaborated by Newcastle University, Heriot-Watt
        University and the University of York under the guidance of my tutor Dr.
        Mauro Dragone. My responsibility is to carry out communication with
        about 1,000 underwater sensors and optical communication core equipment
        with Lora Technology, and encrypt and transmit the transmission
        information through OTAA protocol (over the air activation). TDMA
        protocol is used to help Lora Gateway on the water better allocate time
        and avoid information conflicts, maximizing the hardware advantage to
        send commands from the terminal and upload the data obtained from the
        sensor to an IOT platform called thingsboard through MQTT protocol. By
        participating in this experiment, I understood the operating mode of
        OTAA, ABP and other protocols, and used MicroPython to program Lora
        Gateway and development board composed of Pytrack and Lopy4. At the same
        time, I learned how to effectively use the dashboard of IOT platform and
        how to get data from IOT platform through data mining. In addition, I
        also used Python to achieve MQTT and other algorithms.

        I used to design a robot for entertainment venues together with other
        five team members. Acted as the team leader and C++ engineer, I
        undertook a majority of responsibilities, including the design of the
        state machine, serial communications and different user modes. In our
        design, the development board uses the serial communication to call the
        user-defined function to read the color sensor, infrared sensor and
        distance sensor other sensors to judge the game process and drive the
        motor accurately according to the process. After realizing the reading
        and calling of basic sensor and servo, I added user mode (including easy
        mode and hard mode) and maintain mode for better user experience. We
        experienced some setbacks in the process, such as inoperative sensor and
        breakdown of power supplies, but through repeated debugging and
        persistent trying, we successfully complete it. In the final assessment,
        our product ranked in the first place among 97 competitors.

        <h4>EPSRC USMART</h4>
        <p>
          It is a 3 year, Â£1.3M collaboration between Newcastle University,
          Heriot-Watt University and the University of York to develop
          affordable technology for large scale, smart wireless sensing networks
          to be deployed in the oceans.

        My past experience: Design a State machine and realized the serial port
        communication of MBED development board and FPGA as well as PC by
        setting up protocols, as the group leader, web designer, chief digital
        systems engineer. • Utilized modular structure to simplify the
        transmission and mechanical control system. • Designed several modes
        containing user mode and maintain mode for better encapsulation. • Met
        customers’ requirements on machine interactivity, the entertaining needs
        and the criteria for project automation; stood out with the highest
        score (1/97).

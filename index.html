        Photography isn’t the only way to capture the world, but it certainly is
        one of the most effective. Look no further than the nearest social media
        feed, news station, magazine article, or book cover to see it –
        photographs have power. If you want to harness that power and learn how
        to take the best possible photos, welcome to “Photography Basics: The
        Beginner’s Guide.” This comprehensive tutorial explains the fundamental
        concepts you should know about photography from start to finish. Today,
        many people today like learning about photography online, which is a
        great way to search through large amounts of information (and carry a
        reference in your pocket). But as good as the internet is for answering
        questions, it’s not always geared toward studying a large topic from
        start to finish.

        After operating Photography Life for more than a decade, we decided it
        was time to fill this gap for beginning photographers. As we see it,
        people should be able to start learning photography with little to no
        prior knowledge, dig down for a bit, and emerge with a solid
        understanding of the most important concepts. So, Photography Basics – a
        completely free, online guide to photography – was born. Photography
        Basics is like a book, and it reads from front to back. Each chapter of
        the guide builds on prior chapters. If you start at the very beginning
        and work your way through, the information will flow naturally and in
        the right order. However, if you want to learn something more specific,
        you’re welcome to skip ahead to a later chapter.

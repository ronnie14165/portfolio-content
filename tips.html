        The best designs show text and imagery working together. Instead of just
        slapping words on a photo, create depth and intrigue by having the text
        interact with your background in some way. You might do this by lining
        up the focal point of the image with a word you want to visually
        punctuate. Color is another way to create a relationship between text
        and imagery. Spark Post suggests color palettes based on the colors of
        the photo, so you don’t need to have a degree in color science to land
        on a good combo. (Although, following a few color principles helps.)
        Cycle through the options by tapping a palette until you land on a color
        combination you like.(cite

        Get in close. Zoom decreases your photo quality, but your feet don’t. As
        long as it’s safe, physically move closer to your subject for a better
        photo. Practice every day. Practice makes perfect and photography is no
        exception. Get out there and start taking photos. Check for even
        lighting. Harsh shadows or lack of light will severely impact the look
        of your photo. Get an external light source or schedule your photoshoot
        for the right time. Keep an eye out for composition. Photo composition,
        or the arrangement of visual elements, is key to telling your whole
        story. Keep your batteries charged. Nothing puts a stop to a photoshoot
        faster than dead batteries. Plan out your depth of field. How far away
        is your subject? Is you subject clear and in focus? These questions all
        have to deal with your depth of focus. Watch for the golden hour. The
        Golden hour is the time when natural light is diffused and even. This
        time occurs in the two hours after sunrise or two hours before sunset.
        Stick to the rule of thirds. The rule of thirds will help you compose
        your photo so that nothing is dead center or framed in a visually boring
        way. Keep your subject or composition filling two of three grid lines
        for this trick. Experiment with filters. Filters can help you take your
        photo and make it something special. Check out our resource on the best
        photo filter apps for more information. Learn how to work with motion.
        Read our guide on how to take action photos for help with this. Edit
        your photos. After your photoshoot make sure to take the time to edit
        your favorite photos. Often this will be the step that makes them
        outstanding finished projects. Look to our guide on best photo editing
        apps for help. Keep your photos organized. Our digital scrapbooking tips
        will help make sure nothing is ever lost.(cite from

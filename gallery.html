        Art galleries are often established together in urban centers such as
        the Chelsea district of New York, widely considered to be the center of
        the American contemporary art world. Most large urban areas have several
        art galleries, and most towns will be home to at least one. However,
        they may also be found in small communities, and remote areas where
        artists congregate, e.g. the Château de Montsoreau-Museum of
        Contemporary Art (Montsoreau) in France, the Chinati Foundation (Marfa)
        in United States, the Taos art colony (Taos) in New Mexico and St Ives,
        Cornwall; (Hill End), (Braidwood) and (Byron Bay) in New South Wales
        Contemporary art galleries are usually free and open to the public;
        however, some are semi-private, more exclusive, and by appointment only.

        Galleries tend to cluster in certain neighborhoods within cosmopolitan
        cities for economic and practical reasons, mainly that it is possible
        for the buyers and general public to view more art if they can travel by
        foot. In the past galleries have tended to cluster in neighborhoods with
        affordable real-estate due to the unprofitable nature of the business.
        However, in the 21st century art galleries are strongly associated with
        the process of gentrification, and prime real estate for Chelsea
        galleries is not affordable for unprofitable galleries. Generally,
        cities that have less centralized art districts are faring poorly in
        terms of market share.Galleries run for the public good by cities,
        churches, art collectives, not-for-profit organizations, and local or
        national governments are usually termed Non-Profit Galleries. Galleries
        run by artists are sometimes known as Artist Run Initiatives, and may be
        temporary or otherwise different from the traditional gallery format.
